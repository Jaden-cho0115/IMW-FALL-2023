                    At first, I created a 'calculator' clicking intercation website for Project 3 - Interaction because I was not aware of project instruction where I was supposed to create an abstract website. Before submitting this assignment, I have asked Professor Peter Ha for a feedback and told me to think deeply and research abut how I will create this 'abstract website' within clikcing interaction.

                    Therefore, I have created an website to bring emotional sense to users with image of young plant that looks like it needs water desperately. There will be water ripple animation happening whenever user clicks or even dragging cursour on top of the image. "To feed the young plant." I wish I had more planty of time for me to develop this assignment better, but I hope this sends the message of my intention for this assignment.

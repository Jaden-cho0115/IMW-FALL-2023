        <h2>R1: A Handmade Web</h2>
        <h3>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The thesis of this article, titled "Handmade Web," by J.R Carpenter appears to revolve around the concept of the "handmade web" as a means of preserving and promoting the ideals and practices of early web creation and engagement. The author emphasizes several key points such as Defining the Handmade Web - web pages created through manual coding by individuals rather than software, with an emphasis on provisional, temporary, or pages that challenge various conventions of the modern web, Historical Context - the flourishing of "handmade web" practices in the mid-to-late-1990s, highlighting the contrast between the early, more personal, and creative web and the later corporate-dominated web landscape, and etc. Preserving the creative, individualistic, and experimental aspects of web development in contrast to the commercialization and standardization of the modern web. The author sees the "handmade web" as a form of resistance and a way to reclaim the web's earlier ethos.

        <h3>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are several elements or developments mentioned by the author in this article, that in the digital landscape are being resisted or challenged, such as Commercialization and Standardization of the Web - where the article resists the trend towards a highly commercialized and standardized web environment dominated by multinational corporations, proprietary applications, and content management systems, Homogenization - emphasizing the importance of diverse and experimental web art and writing projects, Loss of Personal Identity - resists the idea that individuals have lost control over their online identities due to the dominance of big social media platforms and commercial websites, Proprietary Technologies - resisting the prevalence of proprietary technologies that limit users' ability to understand and manipulate the web, and etc. In summary, the resistance in this article is primarily directed towards the commercialization, standardization, loss of personal identity, and proprietary nature of the modern web.

        <h3>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the "physicality" of
          the web?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>Reflecting on my own experience with “physicality” website that drew my attention would be “Patatap” https://patatap.com/Links to an external site.. Back when I was little, I was super interested in a “launch pad”, basically a coded machine that stores and plays multiple sound effects, musical instruments, and songs with each button when it gets pressed. Unfortunately, the launch pad’s price was a little big for me at that age, but I still had to fulfill my satisfaction and found Patatap.com, a fully programmed website, eventually found out that it is downloadable on mobile as well for both IOS and Android. I love this website because it wasn’t as boring as any other launch pad simulator kind of stuff where we have very limited sounds and buttons to press, but this Patatap.com provides MANY different sounds in A-Z keyboard bines with 6 different genres or modes that carry all different sound. Also, it was more enjoyable because there is a mix of aural and visual senses that happens whenever buttons get pressed at the same time playing the sound out of your device. I would say this is a fun-coded website and it’s great for those people who are interested in remixing, music, or just to crash times when you are bored.

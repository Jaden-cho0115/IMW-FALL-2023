        <h2>R2: What Screens Want</h2>
        <h3>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The article argues that screens and technology have undergone significant evolution over the years, and their design principles and interactions should be guided by a concept called "flux," which represents the capacity for change in design. It emphasizes the importance of user interface design, the need for a shared language to describe design behaviors, and the potential for reshaping technology and the web to prioritize values such as openness, communication, and community. Ultimately, it calls for reimagining technology and design principles to align with users' goals and desires and break free from limited and biased abstractions.

        <h3>2. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I would say for me I stand to the skeuomorphism side more, which enhances the resemblance of digital elements to our real-world counterparts, thereby aiding users in grasping the functions of these elements with greater ease. However, I do insist flat design is also needed for us, but in terms of sharing feelings with users, and understanding themes, and genres, skeuomorphism is definitely stronger than flat designs. That goes for the functions as well, where it resonates from our human muscle memories, brains, it helps us to reveal the functionalities with its skeuomorphic designs/images. Flat designs I would say it is abstract.

        <h3>3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>The zoopraxiscope, an early motion picture apparatus pioneered by Eadweard Muybridge, serves as a precursor to modern animation and filmmaking techniques. This device, utilizing a rotating glass disc with sequential images, effectively creates the illusion of motion, laying the groundwork for contemporary animation and motion design principles. Its influence on web and interaction design lies in its early exploration of conveying movement through a series of visual frames. A film-related concept that has had a significant impact on digital design I would say is storyboarding, a technique employed in filmmaking to visually plan scenes and shots through sketches or illustrations. In the realm of digital design and user experience (UX), wireframes and prototypes fulfill a similar role, aiding designers in plotting user interfaces, interactions, and user pathways, akin to how storyboards map out the narrative flow of a film.

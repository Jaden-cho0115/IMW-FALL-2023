        <h2>R5: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>
        <h3>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Schwulst advocates for prioritizing individual websites over social media, emphasizing the heightened agency they offer users. A hand-coded website grants full control over the content and its presentation, allowing for greater creative expression compared to the standardized interfaces of social media platforms driven by advertisements. I align with Schwulst's perspective, valuing my personal website as an expansive canvas for self-expression. Through intentional interactions, such as featuring a curated selection of scanned items symbolic of my creative projects, I can provide a more profound insight into my thought process and creative journey. This autonomy in crafting my virtual persona stands in contrast to the limitations imposed by the uniformity of social media interfaces, allowing for endless variations in how I am perceived.
        </p>
        <h3>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post the link here.

            Website as honeycomb<br><br>To me, the website is like a honeycomb. Honeycomb(website), where bees(us) live in. Honeycomb works as hundreds and thousands of rooms in one big house. I personally see the website as one big house with bunch of sources, each sources stands for its own property. For bigger example, I would say the website is like the Earth. If the Earth changes, so as we, but 'we' stand for us each other, and each one of us has different colours. However, even though we all have different colours, we fit as one big group, the sources(bees/humans) for our website(honeycomb/earth).

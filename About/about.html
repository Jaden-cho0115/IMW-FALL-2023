        <h3>Hello & Welcome!</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            My name is Jaden Cho, the owner of this 'JC Dream Web.com'. I am OCAD-Ontario College of Art&Design University student enrolled in Advertising Program.<br><br>This 'JC Dream Web.com' is my implementation of learning outcomes from IMW Fall 2023-GDES-3091-301 Interactive Media: Web course with Professor Peter Ha. Although, it was a tough journey of learning HTML, CSS, and JS, I was able to learn the basic of web developing skills. Coding is a complete new category of my learning process in University, I have to say that it require lots of times to understand what is going on.<br><br>However, now a new category of 'coding' has unlocked into my learning process, which I will begin dig further down in my future. Also, I want to say thanks to Professor Peter Ha for assisting me to open up my motivation of coding.
